In a bid to understand my situation better I truned to my trusty savior GOOGLE. Not encouraging you to do so, if you do do, google more often than not is a doodoo but again YMMW.</p><p>I was diagnosed by google and my self that I have a critical case of braing fog. Which I feel was a decent diagnosis. Onto checking what can be done about it then.</p><h2 id=remedies-for-brain-fog>Remedies for Brain Fog</h2><p>Curing brain fog really depends on you. Being mindful on what your body is going through is really crucial to have a grip on your mental stability.
That being said even if you dont have a good understanding about yourself the following points should help, I hope.</p><p>Some people find that they need to change their diet, while others need to exercise more. Here are a few different things that you can try if you&rsquo;re suffering from brain fog:</p><ul><li><p>Get enough sleep: This is one of the most important things you can do for your overall health, and it&rsquo;s imperative if you&rsquo;re trying to clear up brain fog. Making sure that you&rsquo;re getting at least seven to eight hours of sleep every night. Sleeping before 10 pm would do wonders to our body as well.</p></li><li><p>Eat healthy: Eating a healthy diet is crucial for keeping your mind sharp. Make sure you&rsquo;re eating plenty of fruits, vegetables, and whole grains. Avoiding sugary and processed foods is a sure fire way to reduce a lot of internal infammation and of course reduce mental strain.</p></li><li><p>Exercise: Exercise is excellent for your overall health, and it can also help clear up brain fog. Even if you don&rsquo;t feel like working out, taking a brisk walk around the block can do wonders for your mental clarity.</p></li><li><p>Limit screen time: Too much time spent staring at screens can lead to eye strain and headaches, contributing to brain fog. If possible, limit your screen time to two hours or less per day.</p></li><li><p>Take breaks: When you&rsquo;re feeling overwhelmed or stressed, take a few minutes to yourself to relax and rejuvenate. Taking small breaks throughout the day for couple of minutes after a big deep focus bouts will help you stay refreshed and focused.</p></li></ul><h2 id=my-experience>My Experience</h2><p>I followed these tips, by completely weaning off my digital screens such as laptop, Monitor, Phone, Smartwatch, etc.</p><p>The way I was able to wean off the screens was to inform some of my frequent contacts and at work that I wont be available for few days.</p><p>My target was 48 hours, so I had a book handy to keep me off when I really went crazy.</p><p>Since we are constantly distracted by our digital life we dont know what we are really going through. Getting in touch with your inner-self is very important if you want to lead a happier and more satisfied life.</p><p>So, I in the first day started getting all the negative thoughts I made sure i even limited my talks with my family members this truly gives access to your inner feelings. I gained this access, there came a point I wanted out of this feeling and mental chatter. It is so loud that i couldnt take it and wanted to break out it somehow. I kept immersing myself in the book just to escape from myself. Bad, should have faced it.</p><p>The first night I had a good night&rsquo;s sleep after a very long time. Felt very relaxed, onto the next day. I had another 24 hours to kill.</p><p>Started the day with a workout, still feeling tired to do workout. I was too bored to workout, still having a lot of mental fatigue and fogging. This time instead of reading the book. I let the thoughts go through me. Lot of my thoughs had a weight to it, so much so that I was reacting to it.</p><p>Come evening I felt I haven&rsquo;t seen the evening sun for a very long time. Rainy season is just around where I stay, so the sky is usually gloomy in preparation for the onslaught of rain. Luckily, the sun was out I was able to soak in all of that vitamin D after going for a nice bike ride.</p><p>Again had a good night&rsquo;s sleep with out any digital devices.</p><p>I wouldn&rsquo;t say that all of this will immediately help with brain fog. Maybe givining more time like this will help. 48 hours wasn&rsquo;t enough to completely get rid of my mental chatter but for a brief moment i felt calm.</p><p>I wish to do this more often, and schedule this in. Hopefully, I get even better results as I keep doing this.</p><h2 id=conclusion>Conclusion</h2><p>If you find that you&rsquo;re still struggling with brain fog after trying these tips, it&rsquo;s a good idea to talk to your doctor. There may be an underlying medical condition that&rsquo;s causing your symptoms. Once you get to the root of the problem, you can start feeling clearheaded and energized again.</p><p>Brain fog can be frustrating, but there are ways to clear it up. By following these tips, you&rsquo;ll be on your way to a sharper mind I guess YMMW.</p></div><div class=post__footer><span><a class=tag href=/tags/mental-health/>Mental-Health</a><a class=tag href=/tags/self-care/>Self-Care</a><a class=tag href=/tags/digital-break/>Digital-Break</a></span></div></div></main></div><footer class="footer footer__base"><ul class=footer__list><li class=footer__item>&copy;
