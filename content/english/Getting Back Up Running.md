It's been a while since i posted. I will be starting to post most frequently henceforth. 

I use cursor a lot for my exploratory development. But when my laptop is not around I do need to repeatedly copy code back and forth between the ai interface and my IDE at that moment. 

And that's a genuine problem which cursor solved. Thank God! Well now that initial limitations of context length barrier has been breached beyond 64k tokens. Heck some of them in millions i would just full send the entire codebase. It really sucks to copy or select each file recursively. 

I came across this interesting project called CodeWeaver. It just converts the entire codebase into markdown document that i can then feed to my choice of LLM.
